# RH-Stock-Options-Screener
Uses the robin_stocks API to screen options based on price, date, symbol, volume, greeks, etc.  Results are graphed using pyplot.

Currently, the program requires a text editor to input your username and password (required to search robinhood.com), as well as to modify fields that will filter your results.  

Given more time, I would create a GUI for this project (using Tkinter most likely) as I think it would be beneficial.
